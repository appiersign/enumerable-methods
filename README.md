# Enumerable Microverse Project
This project served as an assessment of my understanding of loops and conditionals.
It involved writing identical ruby enumerable methods, which gave me the opportunity to
express my understanding of the use of block and procs.
The methods I worked on are:
- my_each?
- my_each_with_index?
- my_select?
- my_all?
- my_any?
- my_none?
- my_count?
- my_map?
- my_inject?
